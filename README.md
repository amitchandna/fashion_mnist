## A stab at the classic hello world project with a neural net

* The purpose of this notebook/script is to take a classic dataset, flatten it and the run it through 4-5 layers of a neural net (shallowish) to provide a model that is able to predict to a high degree of accuracy what a new photo may be as far as we are concerned from the fashion mnist perspective.

- This has been developed both as a script and as a jupyter notebook and can be further seen in either medium for you viewing pleasure. 

Hopefully you enjoy what you see!
