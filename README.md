## A stab at the classic hello world project with a neural net

* The Fashion MNIST data set was created by Zalando to help improve computer vision after the original MNIST data set was created. This script aims to take a stab at this CV problem with an artificial neural network (ANN). It has been developed over many iterations and is still a work in progress but at this point it should be readable. This project has created a (shallow) artificial neural net that looks to accuratley 

* The purpose of this notebook/script is to take a classic dataset, flatten it and the run it through 4-5 layers of a neural net (shallowish) to provide a model that is able to predict to a high degree of accuracy what a new photo may be as far as we are concerned from the fashion mnist perspective.

- This has been developed both as a script and as a jupyter notebook and can be further seen in either medium for you viewing pleasure. 

Hopefully you enjoy what you see!
